1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,633
If an N times N square matrix has

2
00:00:03,733 --> 00:00:07,692
N distinct egienvalues, then it is diagonalizable

3
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:11,540
Which of the following answers is correct for this statement.

4
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:19,108
A, true. B, false. C, it depends. Or D, I don't know.

5
00:00:23,266 --> 00:00:25,494
The correct answer is A

6
00:00:28,733 --> 00:00:32,198
To understand why this is the correct answer, let

7
00:00:32,298 --> 00:00:35,545
us take a look at Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors

8
00:00:36,666 --> 00:00:41,860
Let's consider a generic matrix A of size N times N, with

9
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:47,246
eigenvalues lambda 1, lambda 2 all the way up to lambda N.

10
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:50,948
Let lambda I be a generic eigenvalue of A.

11
00:00:51,066 --> 00:00:55,214
V I is the eigenvector corresponding tolambda I

12
00:01:01,866 --> 00:01:05,726
so lambda I determines how V I stretches after

13
00:01:05,866 --> 00:01:08,358
applying the transformation A.

14
00:01:20,466 --> 00:01:24,038
Now consider a different eigenvalue lambda J

15
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:27,268
Where lambda J and lambda I are distinct

16
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:31,932
then let V J be the eigenvector corresponding to lambda J

17
00:01:49,066 --> 00:01:52,326
Eigenvectors of two different eigenvalues

18
00:01:52,466 --> 00:01:55,126
must be linearly independent.

19
00:02:08,133 --> 00:02:11,921
One eigenvector cannot be associated to

20
00:02:12,066 --> 00:02:14,974
two different eigenvalues, because it cannot

21
00:02:15,074 --> 00:02:17,366
be stretched in two different ways.
