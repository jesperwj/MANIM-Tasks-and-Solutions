1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,266
If an N times N square matrix has

2
00:00:03,366 --> 00:00:06,780
N distinct eigenvalues, then it is diagonalizable

3
00:00:06,883 --> 00:00:10,335
Which of the following answers is correct for this statement.

4
00:00:10,433 --> 00:00:14,605
Option A , true. B, false. C, it depends. Or D, I don't know.

5
00:00:18,716 --> 00:00:20,008
The correct answer is A

6
00:00:24,216 --> 00:00:26,963
To understand why this is the correct answer, let

7
00:00:27,063 --> 00:00:29,636
us take a look at Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors

8
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:34,254
Let's consider a generic matrix A of size N times N, with

9
00:00:34,354 --> 00:00:37,922
eigenvalues lambda 1, lambda 2 all the way up to lambda N.

10
00:00:38,033 --> 00:00:40,693
Let lambda I be a generic eigenvalue of A.

11
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:43,964
V I is the eigenvector corresponding tolambda I

12
00:00:50,566 --> 00:00:53,634
so lambda I determines how V I stretches after

13
00:00:53,750 --> 00:00:55,474
applying the transformation A.

14
00:01:07,583 --> 00:01:10,339
Now consider a different eigenvalue lambda J

15
00:01:10,450 --> 00:01:12,966
Where lambda J and lambda I are distinct

16
00:01:13,066 --> 00:01:16,950
then let V J be the eigenvector corresponding to lambda J

17
00:01:34,066 --> 00:01:36,990
Eigenvectors of two different eigenvalues

18
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:39,328
must be linearly independent.

19
00:01:52,333 --> 00:01:55,089
One eigenvector cannot be associated to

20
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,479
two different eigenvalues, because it cannot

21
00:01:57,579 --> 00:01:59,372
be stretched in two different ways.

22
00:02:03,483 --> 00:02:05,759
Let's go back to the original question:

23
00:02:05,866 --> 00:02:09,990
If an N times N square matrix has N different eigenvalues

24
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:11,776
is it diagonalizable?
